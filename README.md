# ChallengeWeek1-Accessibility

## Description
Challenge to increase accessibility of an existing website.  
In this challenge, I took an existing template and increased the user's accessibility to it. This helps the webpage's web results and provides access to users with certain disabilities. I did this by adding alt tags to images, and making the site accessible without stylesheets.  
I then cleaned up the HTML and CSS code. I used semantic HTML elements and consolidated the CSS elements.
